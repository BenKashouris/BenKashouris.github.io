Hi, I’m Ben Kashouris, a second-year Mathematics student at the University of Nottingham with a strong passion for cryptography—especially lattice-based schemes and post-quantum security. I achieved a 90% average in my first-year modules, reflecting my dedication and aptitude for the subject.
Originally focusing on Computer Science before deciding that maths was a better fit, I maintain a keen enthusiasm for programming and computational theory.
On this site, you’ll find a variety of projects and blog posts, including a cellular automaton working on a 3D surface, a statistical analysis project identifying the optimal aim point on a dartboard, and an exploration of using the square-and-multiply method to efficiently calculate Fibonacci numbers.
I’m highly proficient in Python, have foundational knowledge of C++, and will soon be advancing my skills with an upcoming module in functional programming focused on Haskell.
