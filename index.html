Hi, I'm Ben Kashouris, a second-year Mathematics student at the University of Nottingham with a strong passion for cryptography—especially lattice-based schemes and post-quantum security. I achieved a 90% average in my first-year modules, reflecting my dedication and aptitude for the subject.

Originally focusing on Computer Science before deciding that maths was a better fit, I maintain a keen enthusiasm for programming and computational theory.

On this site, you'll find a variety of projects and blog posts, including a cellular automaton working on a 3D surface, a statistical analysis project identifying the optimal aim point on a dartboard, and an exploration of using the square-and-multiply method to efficiently calculate Fibonacci numbers.

I'm highly proficient in Python, am proficient in R, and will soon be advancing my skills with an upcoming module in functional programming focused on Haskell.
